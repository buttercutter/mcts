# mcts
A simple vanilla Monte-Carlo Tree Search implementation in python 

TODO : 

1. Attach a tic-tac-toe neural network to the MCTS in order to verify the correctness of my MCTS coding because now the tree keeps expanding without any terminal state, thus the need for some games to make sure that the tree actually gives correct winning result

2. Investigate the PUCT formula more in-depth especially [Hoeffdingâ€™s Inequality](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html)

3. Review the BAI-MCTS paper : [Monte-Carlo Tree Search by Best Arm Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02986)
