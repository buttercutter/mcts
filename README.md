# mcts
A simple vanilla Monte-Carlo Tree Search implementation in python 

TODO : 

1. The MCTS logic is now using neural network as its simulation backbone engine, will consider to use Deep Q-learning method later

2. Investigate the [PUCT formula](https://slides.com/crem/lc0#/9) more in-depth especially [Hoeffdingâ€™s Inequality](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html) and its [weakness](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00747575v4/document#page=27)

3. Review the BAI-MCTS paper : [Monte-Carlo Tree Search by Best Arm Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02986)
